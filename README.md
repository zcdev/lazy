# <h1>LAZY Responsive Webpage Template</h1>
<p>
<strong>It's just that LAZY! Easy template for LAZY coding!</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> This template is HTML5 semantic, but you can swap the tags to &lt;div&gt;.</li>
<li> It is a 10-grid system.</li>
<li> It targets common tablet and mobile devices.</li>
<li> On tablet it shows max 3 columns for major content blocks.</li>
<li> On Mobile it shows only 1 column.</li>
<li> The entire template is less than 20KB.</li>
<li> It uses FLEXBOX and serves no due delegence for old IEs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>To switch things on and off - the LAZY way:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> To remove aside, simply insert class "remove" onto &lt;aside&gt;.</li>
<li> To reverse aside to the right, simply insert class "reverse" onto &lt;body&gt;.</li>
<li> To turn specific row of columns into full width, simply insert class "full" onto the row element.</li>
<li> You can turn the logo area into a nav menu if you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>LAZY and easy enough? Huh? :-P</strong>
</p>
<p>
I've done most of the work for you, included calculating all percentages and proportions!<br>
It's sooo simple that you can easily add anything on top of this layout structure.
