LAZY Responsive Webpage Template

It's just that LAZY! Easy template for LAZY coding!
===================================================
+ This template is HTML5 semantic, but you can swap the tags to &lt;div&gt;.
+ It is a 10-grid system.
+ It targets common tablet and mobile devices.
+ On tablet it shows max 3 columns for major content blocks.
+ On Mobile it shows only 1 column.
+ The entire template is less than 20KB.
+ It uses FLEXBOX and serves no due delegence for old IEs.
<br>
===================================================
<br>
To switch things on and off - the LAZY way:
+ To remove aside, simply insert class "remove" onto &lt;aside&gt;.
+ To reverse aside to the right, simply insert class "reverse" onto &lt;body&gt;.
+ To turn specific row of columns into full width, simply insert class "full" onto the row element.
+ You can turn the logo area into a nav menu if you like.

LAZY and easy enough? Huh? :-P
I've done most of the work for you, included calculating all percentages and proportions!
It's sooo simple that you can easily add anything on top of this layout structure.
